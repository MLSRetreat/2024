# 2024

Hello and welcome to the MLS GitHub.

Using ChatGPT:

ChatGPT essentially created this website. If you have any questions or need guidance, it should be your first point of call.

Getting Started:

1. Download GitHub Desktop:

Visit GitHub Desktop and download the application.
Install and launch it on your computer.

2. Login to GitHub Desktop:

Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with the MLS GitHub account. This should be provided to you by the previous committee.

3. Accessing the Repository:

In GitHub Desktop, go to the "File" menu and select "Clone Repository".
Find and select the "2023" repository from the list. It's where our project is stored.

4. Creating a New Folder:

In GitHub Desktop, go to the "File" menu and select "New Repository".
Create a new folder named 2024, or whatever year it is, and make sure it's located where you prefer to store your projects. Copy everything from 2023 into your new folder. Make it public. Change the old website to private.
Now you should work from the new folder and you can delete the old folder from your computer (but keep it on GitHub).

5. Setting Up Your Development Environment:

Download Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Visit Visual Studio Code and download the code editor.
Install and open it. 

6. Open Your Project in VSCode:

In VSCode, go to "File" and select "Open Folder". Choose the folder where you cloned the repository (the one you created eg. 2024).

7. Editing Files:

In VSCode, you'll see the files for the website in the file explorer on the left. You can double-click any file to edit it.

8. Making Changes and Saving:

Make the changes you want to the HTML, CSS, or any other files. Remember to save your changes or the next step won't work!!!

9. Updating the Repository:

First, in GitHub Desktop, you'll see the changes you made. Write a brief description of what you changed and click "Commit".
After committing, click the "Push origin" button. This uploads your changes to the repository on GitHub.

10. Checking out the website:

You should now be able to access the website at https://mlsretreat.github.io/"year" (eg. https://mlsretreat.github.io/2024)



File structure:

The "docs" folder contains all the scripts for making the website work. 
You have to have an "index.html" file which will be your homepage but you can name the rest however you like.
Each html file is a separate page of the website.

The "Images" folder contains all the images. To reference this folder in the script use "Images/filename.xyz"


Re-using the scripts:

If you want to keep things really simple, just update the text and images in the html files. You won't have to touch the .css file. 
If you are feeling creative, go ahead and change the design of the website! Remember to check that it looks good both on big screens as well as mobile devices.
ChatGPT can probably help you here.
